\subsection{Design Overview}
\input{members/ssr/authors}

The designed system for the purpose of yield prediction is founded on one central assumption: 
the main metric for vital growth is the leaf area index (LAI) which determines the PAR:

\begin{quote}
    \centering
    Leaf area index (LAI) is the total one‐sided area of leaf tissue per unit ground surface area.
    It is a key parameter in ecophysiology, especially for scaling up the gas exchange from leaf
    to canopy level.
    It characterizes the canopy–atmosphere interface, where most of the energy fluxes exchange. \cite{breda}
\end{quote}

For this purpose a plant model is defined in the following section which is used to compute the LAI

\input{members/ssr/modelling/plant-model.tex}

\subsection{Computational Pipelines}

To measure this central metric, two computation pipelines are combined to extract specific metrics from images.
Each pipeline applies a series of image processing and computations in order to contribute to the result
in the following ways:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Pipeline A:} Estimates the \textit{leaf area} (not LAI) which is the visible canopy
    of a single plant, captured by camera mounted above of the plants.
    \item \textbf{Pipeline B:} Estimates the plant height, based on an image taken from a different camera,
    with a specific setup.
\end{enumerate}

Both metrics are then combined (with additional statistical corrections) to estimate the actual LAI.
Again, the LAI is different from the \textit{leaf area} in the way that it contains
the \textit{entire} existing leaf area and not only the leaf area which is visible from above.
